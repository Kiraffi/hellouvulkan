- Add rendertargets
    Maybe just a list with
        RenderResolutionFull,
        RenderResolutionQuarter,
        Some custom resolution for X,
        WindowResolution (editor?)

- Try to make adding new project easier, less repeating stuff, copy pasteing?
    Currently there is a lot of copy paste, like the buffer setup. Should figure out how to fix this.
        Would make sense to have some 3d specific buffer binded at some slot, and 2d maybe another.
            Also common for something.... Then this could be made as a function call.
    How much should I really specialize the render paths between projects?
        It probably makes very little sense that you can define different rendering strategies on different
            projects.
    If using global static systems like fontrendersystem, inputsystem, etc. there could be single cpp/h
        file with header that does common initialization. Might look bit ugly code-wise and is kind of
        same as inheriting from base class....

- Add maybe render systems, or systems in general?
    What if I want to read Input from different systems?
        How to communicate between systems? Just global accessors?
    Builder pattern?

- Look serialization maybe once again? Could it be just something super simple?
    It has some read write access for etc... way overcomplex.
    Was thinking of multithreading, but would I really?

- Animation system? Maybe a lot in the future.
    There is not much of animation system...

- There is no particlesystem

- Sounds?

- Builders... Use builder for creategraphicspipeline and createcomputepipeline.

- There is no gameplay... Project bonkers.... Lots of blendering for evenings?
    Needs character, maybe should just go with cube
    Needs enemies, again cubes?
    Needs map, again simple stuff?

- Rendering pipeline pretty much missing
    Shadows broken...
    Tonemap and lighting are quite random.

- GUI?
    Making very simple gui?
    Using Imgui?
